## 0. TL;DR — Top 5

1. **Working directory**: `/Users/jie.feng/wlb/Kairos`, remote `origin = https://github.com/Shadowell/Kairos.git`, main branch `main`.
2. **`git add -A && git commit && git push`** immediately after modifying the code, there is no need to ask for user consent again (see §6).
3. **Answers must be in Chinese** (User Rules).
4. **File operation**: Use Read/Grep/Glob for reading, StrReplace/Write for editing, **Do not use `cat/sed/awk/echo >`** instead.
5. **Retraining/Long Task**: Run in remote AutoDL by default, do not try GPU training on local macOS; see `docs/AUTODL_REMOTE_TRAINING_GUIDE.md` for details.

## 1. Repository Positioning

Kairos is a **crypto spot and perpetual-swap fine-tuning and deployment toolbox** for the [Kronos](https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos) base model:

- **Data collection** — `kairos.data.collect` + `kairos.data.markets.crypto`, covering OKX-compatible spot and USDT-margined perpetual swaps
- **Feature engineering** — `kairos.data.common_features` (24 common dimensions) + `adapter.market_features` (8 market-specific dimensions) = fixed 32-dimensional `EXOG_COLS`, with **no future-information leakage**
- **Dataset packaging** — `kairos.data.prepare_dataset` (time-split / interleave-split; always writes `meta.json`)
- **Model** — `kairos.models.KronosWithExogenous` (Kronos + exogenous channel + quantile regression head; `n_exog=32` is fixed across markets)
- **Training** — `kairos.training.train_predictor` (DDP + gradual unfreezing + early stopping) plus presets such as `kairos.training.config.preset_for("crypto-1min")`
- **Evaluation** — `kairos.training.backtest_ic` (IC / Rank-IC / ICIR; supports `--aggregation date/hour/minute/none`, and recovers market/frequency from `meta.json`)
- **Deployment** — `kairos.deploy.push_to_hf` / `kairos.deploy.serve`

See `docs/CONCEPTS_AND_GLOSSARY.md` for full terminology and background.

## 4. Code specifications

- **Python 3.10+**, follow the style of existing files (don't reformat the entire file without forcing the introduction of black/ruff).
- **No nonsense comments**. `# import pandas`, `# return results` will be deleted directly. Only comment when expressing intent/tradeoffs/constraints.
- **Do not write emoji** unless the user actively requests it in README/docs.
- **Type annotation**: Add new functions as much as possible; when changing existing functions, just keep the style consistent, and don't make major changes just to add type hints.
- **No future information leakage**: Any new factors put into `kairos/data/features.py` must only use data from `t` time and before; the z-score window in the packaging phase is fixed to 60 days rolling.
- **CLI Entry**: When adding a new executable script, register it under `[project.scripts]` of `pyproject.toml` and name it with the prefix `kairos-`.

---

## 5. Testing and Verification

- Change `kairos/data/*` → Run `kairos-prepare --max-symbols 5 --dry-run` (or the smallest subset) to confirm that it is not exploded.
- Change `kairos/training/*` → Run `KAIROS_SMOKE=1 python -m kairos.training.train_predictor` local CPU first.
- Change `kairos/models/*` → Load Kronos-small weights at least once to verify that state_dict matches.
- **No CI**, the agent is responsible for local verification. If there is `pytest`, run `pytest -x`.

---

## 6. Git commit rules (important)

### 6.1 Trigger timing
**As long as a "logically complete change" is completed - such as fixing a bug, adding a document, adjusting a set of super parameters - commit + push immediately without asking the user. **

Exceptions (in these cases you must stop and ask the user first):
- When `git push --force` / `--force-with-lease` is required;
- When changing to a branch other than `main`/creating a new branch/merging PR;
- When the commit will contain files that look like **key, token, API key, `.env`, `credentials.*`**;
- When the user explicitly says "Don't push it yet" / "I want to see it".

### 6.2 Commit message style
- **English, imperative sentence, capitalized, no period**, refer to existing history:
  ```
  Fix repo URLs to Shadowell/Kairos and add package init placeholders
  Harden training loop: data fallbacks, interleave split, early-stop, IC backtest
  Add AutoDL guide and glossary; cross-link from README/playbook
  ```
- One-line title ≤ 72 characters; if necessary, leave a blank line and then write the body.
- **One commit does one thing**, don't stuff "bug fixes + refactoring + adding documents" together.

### 6.3 Standard actions
```bash
git status                          # Take a look first
git add -A
git commit -m "<imperative subject>"
git push                            # Push to origin/main
git status                          # Confirm clean + "up to date"
```
Use the HEREDOC form to avoid escaping problems:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Subject line here

Optional body explaining *why*, not *what*.
EOF
)"
```

### 6.4 Things not to do
- ❌ `git commit --amend` The commit that has been pushed.
- ❌ `git push --force` to `main`.
- ❌ `git config` Change the global/repository configuration.
- ❌ `git rebase -i` / `git add -i` (Interactive commands cannot be run).
- ❌ Submit `raw/` / `artifacts/` / `finetune/data/` / `.venv/` / `*.pkl` / `*.parquet` / checkpoint.
- ❌ Submit any file containing a key: `.env` / `*.secret` / `*.pem` / `*.key` / `secrets/` (`.gitignore` has been intercepted, but take a second look at `git status` before doing it).

### 6.5 Secrets Agreement
- All API keys/tokens are passed through **environment variables**, with names in the form `OKX_API_KEY` / `OKX_API_SECRET` / `OKX_API_PASSPHRASE` / `BINANCE_API_KEY` / `HF_TOKEN`.
- During development, fill in the value into `.env` (git-ignored) and load it with `set -a; source .env; set +a`.
- The public template is in `.env.example` (tracked), and the template is updated simultaneously when adding required variables.
- Public market data (K line / funding / OI) does not require any key, and the crypto adapter uses anonymous requests by default.

## 7. Known pitfalls and fixed processing methods

|symptom|root cause|deal with|
|---|---|---|
|`kairos-collect` stuck with no output|Dongcai API is restricted|Existing fallback → tencent → sina; `--workers 1`|
|`kairos-prepare` reported `Parquet magic bytes not found`|macOS `._*` metadata file|The packaging script has been filtered `startswith("._")`; used for transmission `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar --no-xattrs`|
|`kairos-prepare` were all dropped|`amount` List all NaN|Fallbacked to `close * volume`|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: kairos` |venv is not activated or not `pip install -e .`| `source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .` |
|AutoDL stuck at `loading Kronos-Tokenizer-base`|`http_proxy` and `HF_ENDPOINT=hf-mirror.com` conflict|`unset http_proxy https_proxy`; Pre-cache `huggingface-cli download` in advance|
|`numpy` 2.x causes torch to crash|version conflict| `pip install "numpy<2"` |
|DDP cannot run on CPU|default nccl|`training_utils.setup_ddp` Automatically cut gloo|
|The office network blocked OKX/Binance main site|GFW + Company Whitelist|Use `--exchange binance_vision` to go to the `data-api.binance.vision` spot mirror, which can only pull the spot K line (no funding/OI/basis)|
|AutoDL is blocked by default `api.okx.com` / `fapi.binance.com`|DNS Pollution + Squid only whitelist github/hf for `/etc/network_turbo`|Install mihomo (Clash Meta) + airport subscription on AutoDL; get YAML from `flag=meta`; pre-download `Country.mmdb` + `GeoSite.dat` + `geoip.dat` and put it in the `-d` directory; the default GLOBAL is `DIRECT`, you need to use `PUT /proxies/GLOBAL` to switch to the specific node (the US node is the fastest measured, ~1.1s/req). See `docs/CRYPTO_OKX_PERP_MULTICHANNEL_PLAN.md` for complete steps|
|Swap run has `funding_rate` / `oi_change` / `basis` all zero|`--crypto-extras` was not collected, sidecar parquet is missing, or OKX returned no historical coverage|Report sidecar coverage and rerun collection with `--crypto-extras funding,open_interest,spot,reference`; see `docs/CRYPTO_OKX_SPOT_PERP_EXOGENOUS_PLAN.md`|
|The parquet time range offset pulled out by `binance_vision`|`_to_unix_ms` Use naive local time to convert to UTC|Expected behavior, does not affect training for 24/7 crypto; if you really want accurate UTC date boundary, just manually transfer the complete ISO time|
|The native macOS `torchrun --standalone` is stuck in a pile of `IPv6 ... gai error: 8` warnings for a long time|macOS fails to resolve the local hostname to IPv6, and the rendezvous server of `torchrun` hangs on the hostname and times out.|Single card/native machine does not use torchrun for smoke, just `MASTER_ADDR=127.0.0.1 MASTER_PORT=295xx WORLD_SIZE=1 RANK=0 LOCAL_RANK=0 python -m kairos.training.train_predictor`; AutoDL/GPU machine still uses torchrun normally.|
|When smoke `OneCycleLR` throws `ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero`|`total_steps = epochs * steps_per_epoch` If it is too small, `int(pct_start * total_steps)` degenerates to 0 and the phase boundaries coincide.|`KAIROS_SMOKE=1` has set `n_train_iter` to 200 and `warmup_pct=0.2` to ensure `total_steps ≥ ~50`; this lower limit must also be observed when customizing smoke|
|`backtest_ic --per-symbol-limit` After running `by_date_mean.ic` all are `NaN`|Each symbol is independently and equidistantly sampled, and the timestamps extracted are not aligned → there is only 1 record in each bucket, and the cross-sectional correlation coefficient cannot be calculated.|Smoke can use `--aggregation none` to see the overall; to check the bucket IC on a small number of symbols, either `--stride 60` let all symbols use the same set of offsets, or directly run the GPU with full stride=1|
| `ccxt.base.errors.InvalidProxySettings: okx you have multiple conflicting proxy settings(httpProxy,httpsProxy)` |`check_proxy_settings` with ccxt ≥ 4.5 is not allowed to set `http_proxy` + `https_proxy` at the same time; earlier versions of OKX adapter have both blocked|`kairos/data/markets/crypto_exchanges/okx.py` Now only set up `https_proxy` (commit `9e33a2f`), OKX uses all HTTPS; when writing a new adapter, be careful to only leave the https side.|
|`[<sym>] funding fetch failed: 'timestamp'` or OI `50030 Illegal time range`|The `since` kwarg of ccxt is ignored by the server on the OKX funding-history / OI interface → the latest data returned is filtered to empty by `[start_ms,end_ms)` → subsequent `df["timestamp"]` KeyError|adapter is now changed to `params={"after": cursor}` to check funding, `params={"begin":...,"end":...}` to check OI (commit `05b8595`); at the same time, empty frame retains `funding_rate`/`open_interest` columns to avoid KeyError|
|OKX funding / OI short historical window|Hard retention of OKX API: funding-rate-history ~90 days; contracts/open-interest-history only returns the latest ~8 hours** (100 items × 5m), `after` cursor does not take effect on this endpoint|**funding**: The data within the past 90 days is OK for training; for older windows, empty tables must be accepted or Coinglass must be used. **OI**: Currently you can only subscribe in real time and accumulate orders yourself; short window smoke can be used, but the OI column of Top100 × 1 year training will be 0 (the same as the old BTC/ETH spot run), which must be clearly marked in the document|
|`kairos-prepare --train 2026-04-13:2026-04-13` Each symbol is packaged into only **1 line**|`_slice` uses `(datetime >= start) & (datetime <= end)`, `end="2026-04-13"` is parsed into `2026-04-13 00:00:00`, and the minute-level data only has one hit at 00:00|For minute-level data `--train/--val/--test`, you need to pass "next day" as end (`2026-04-13:2026-04-14` means covering the whole day from 04-13), or pass the complete ISO timestamp (be careful not to have 3 colons, `parse_range` use `:` to hard cut)|

## 8. Training/backtest current baseline

### crypto 1min(crypto-1min)

| run | universe | h30 rank-IC (finetuned) | h30 ICIR |Details|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTC+ETH 2y spot |2 coins × 2 years| **+0.050** | **+0.325** | `docs/CRYPTO_BTC_ETH_2Y_SPOT_RUN.md` |
| Top100 1y spot |100 coins × 1 year| +0.030 | **+0.454** | `docs/CRYPTO_TOP100_1Y_SPOT_RUN.md` |
| Top10 30d perp ⚠️ |10 coins × 30 days|+0.016 (n=3 noise)| +0.06 |`docs/CRYPTO_OKX_PERP_TOP10_30D_RUN_POSTMORTEM.md` (negative migration post-mortem)|

h30 is currently the only valid horizon (preset `return_horizon=30` aligned), h1/h5 is not really supervised due to the training target dimension design, and the IC is close to 0 or reverse. For improvement directions, see `docs/BACKTEST_IC_INTERPRETATION_GUIDE.md` §4 and `docs/TRAINING_TUNING_PLAYBOOK.md` §8.2.

### BSQ Tokenizer(crypto-1min, Kairos-base-crypto)

Currently only completed code + local CPU smoke (50 steps / M1 CPU / 17 s) - `recon_mse_full` dropped from 0.00557 of baseline to 0.00518 (-7%), proving that the link is working. **Official run must be run on AutoDL, see `docs/CRYPTO_BTC_ETH_TOKENIZER_RUN.md`** for complete steps.
Tokenizer training ≈ 4M parameters, batch=50, epochs=15 + patience=3, lr=2e-4, fully unfrozen, expected to be completed in 5–10 minutes on 5090.

When changing super parameters, always change `kairos/training/config.py` to `TrainConfig`. Do not hard-code numbers into `train_predictor.py`. The cross-market parameter combination is `preset_for(name)` - when creating a new market/frequency, add a **synchronization** to `_PRESETS` instead of letting the caller spell the dict by himself.

### Architectural Invariants (Phase 2)

1. `len(COMMON_EXOG_COLS) + len(adapter.MARKET_EXOG_COLS) == 32`——This must be maintained when adding a new adapter, `build_features` will directly assert and throw an error.
2. `n_exog` on the model side is fixed at 32, and does not follow the adapter. If you want to add new factors, occupy pad or replace a certain slot, and do not expand the dimension.
3. Optional venue dependencies must fail gracefully at import time; command-line errors should happen only when the selected exchange is instantiated.
4. `kairos-prepare` The output directory must contain `meta.json`, otherwise the downstream `backtest_ic --dataset-path ...` cannot restore market/freq.

---

## 9. document maintenance

- README is the external facade, changes should be refined; details should be written in `docs/`.
- When adding `docs/*.md`, add a line of links to `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`, the document entry area of ​​README and `AGENTS.md` §2.
- Check `docs/CONCEPTS_AND_GLOSSARY.md` for terms first, and fill in any missing terms; do not define the same term repeatedly in multiple documents.

---

## 10. Maintenance of this document itself

- The **long-term agreement** given by the user in the conversation (for example, Article 6.1 of this document is extracted from the user's "commit + push after each modification") should be settled here.
- Changing `AGENTS.md` itself also applies to the rules in Section 6: commit + push immediately after making changes.
